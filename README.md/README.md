User Story:

My wife and I want to try some new recipes so we want  a place where we can make a wishlist of  these recipes that includes a link to the website, date the recipe was added to the list, if we have tried the recipe yet and the rating of the recipe.

When you click on the recipe a new page will be brought up where you can make a shopping list of ingredients that will allow you to add, edit or remove items so that you can be prepared before shopping and while you shop you can remove items from the list that you have purchased.

I would also like to add a comment section where we can add comments on what we thought of the recipe, as well as a rating system that will display on the page with the listed recipes.
